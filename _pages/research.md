Improving the resolution and accuracy of cardiovascular phenotypes will lead to novel insights and therapies. This can occur by drilling down—understanding the genetic and cellular mechanism of a particular disease—or going broad, using computational means to analyze precision phenotypes at scale.

Dr. Arnaout is currently developing computational methods to bring precision phenotyping to echocardiography. Her background as a physician-scientist informs the future scope of this work as a technology that can transform non-invasive imaging into a big-data tool for both research and clinical use. She also uses the zebrafish animal model to study cardiovascular developmental gene function and to model human cardiovascular disease.
